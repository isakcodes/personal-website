## Come grab some

After my [previous post on coding projects](http://isakengstrom.com/2021/01/31/coding-for-fun/) I thought I'd share some ideas for small-scope coding projects. Ideally ones that someone with a decent coding competence could actually finish in a reasonably short timeframe (around 4 hours to 2 weeks). If I know a good tutorial, I'll insert a link to it.

Please steal one or two and then claim it as your own without giving any credit. Just promise you'll actually start it.
 
- Twitter clone in Vue (A friend of mine did this in React and got hired because of it + his bachelors in CS)
- A Jekyll blog kind of like this one (if you like mine just take it from my github)
- **Todo:** Add more here... (yup, this is the MVP you're looking at)
