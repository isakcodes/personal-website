title: "Coding for fun?"
---

When I have some time over, I sometimes code recreationally. And to be perfectly honest, I sometimes feel pressured to.

## You need a portfolio. Or at least some kind of neckbeard.

Recruiters ask about personal projects so often that a green-tiled github profile almost becomes a necessity for anyone serious about pursuing a career in software.

You often see people brag about their love of coding in their twitter bios or blogs like this one. More often than not, making sure to cleary signal to everyone that they haven't been burdened with maintaining a social life for the past decade or so.

Sure, it's an odd indicator for coding skill, but consider the alternative. Expecting anything other than pure coding wizardry from such a person is basically an insult.

To their merit, I'm sure most of the tweeting dev-wizards out there actually mean what they say, but the stereotype is all too obvious and a bit cringy. Memes like using `vim` for everything or learning to code at age 3 are so established I shouldn't need to mention.

With a healthy dose of self-irony, I'll use this blogpost to share some of my experience with this peculiar concept of *coding for fun*. And maybe mention something useful about how you could do it. Oh, probably should insert a disclaimer.

Pardon the banter. I'll tone it down. Promise.


## To be real

I'm a mortal like you and understand what it's like to not feel excited about coding projects. Especially with work or lab assignments due.

What has helped me most is going for the smallest, most single-purposed project you can think of, which also amounts to something that you actually care about whether it gets built or not. This helps to just get to a point where you finish stuff, which builds up habit and momentum to go for something bigger.

In most cases, you can just save the optimizations and perfections for later anyway.

## The case against discipline

Most of my hobby projects aren't actually *ever* finished and remain as private forgotten repositories. This isn't neccessarily a big deal, and there aren't any good reasons to feel bad about dropping a project you lost interest in. You're better off ignoring any shame and getting going with something else. In any case, you can't know beforehand what's going to be fun enough to keep you going on internal motivation alone. Sure, being disciplined and using external motivation undoubtedly works, especially with some accountability through social pressure. But it might simply suck all the fun out of it. Discipline is a great habit for your personal character, but isn't appropriate in all areas of life. So I'd say it makes sense to avoid turning hobbies into work. Especially if it's the kind of hobby that won't ever amount to any income.

By staying curious and keen on trying things, you might eventually find a project so fun to you personally that you don't want to stop working on it. That takes something that doesn't feel like work to you, but would look like work from someone else's perspective. I think a lot of the opportunities in people's life that end up working out, are the kind of opportunities that have their roots in something that person enjoys in a uniquely personal way. Which allows directing all their focus into it, becoming better at a rate that makes success easy (provided the slightest amount of talent). In what activity you'll find that special project, nobody else can say. But whatever tickles your interest - not only in thought but in the actual, practical doing of it - probably points you in the right direction.

## So how have I been doing?

It has taken me a few years to get to a point where I actually feel comfortable starting a coding project from scratch. But it gets easier each year, as the things you learn compound. Lately I've gotten better mainly at limiting my scope. Just starting with a Minimum Viable Product increases the odds that I (beyond finishing) actually decide to launch it publicly. This website is one example. I waited for a long time to code a site from scratch, before realizing I could just launch something and change it later if I feel it's not technical enough or whatever.

I just cloned the default Jekyll template for Github pages and got started. I think a lot people (including people far more talented than I) make the mistake of waiting to show their work until it reaches perfection. Which probably never happens with most of what people start tinkering with.

### Currently working on
 
- Finishing a GameBoy emulator in Rust. Mainly to learn the language but also to get some better understanding of virualization and implementing the Z80 processor and it's RISC assembly instructions.
- Java-based algo-trading suite for playing with some RNN-based time series models. Building it with a friend who is quite junior and the idea is to eventually hook it up to Nordnet's API and try our luck with some trading algorithms. It obviously won't actually make us rich, but still a fun project.
- And a few others which are on hold for now.
